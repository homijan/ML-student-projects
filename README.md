# ML-student-projects

# `bogdaale` Project plan

## Meetings
1. Prompt communication is the MOST important skill
2. **Bi-weekly updates**
3. Progress tracking via slides (powerpoint?)
4. "No progress" is a valid update
5. **Always** keep track of your references!
6. We will collaborate via github (PRs = "Pull Requests")

## Physics
1. Start with **Radiation Hydrodynamics** by Castor
2. Our model of reference deterministic kinetics via **Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (Landau)**
3. We want the project's plasma physics be as close as possible to FPTF curriculum
4. Plasma physics in BP should cover: *radiation hydrodynamics for ICF*, *nonlocal transport hydrodynamics*, *VFP and Krook kinetics*

## Programming

### Linux
1. Make yourself comfortable with using the computer via command line (tcsh)
2. Learn basic shell commands
3. SSH or VNC on Ondra Klimo's cluster?

### git
1. `bogdaale` will create his github account (github.com)
2. MH will prepare a github repository and a dedicated **PR for `bogdaale`** to do science &#x2611;
3. Get familiar with the git commands: `git clone`, `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit -m`, `git push`
4. It will be a "steep learning curve" (misnomer), but **IT IS WORTH IT**</li>

### Python3
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scipy

### PyTorch
1. Jupyter
2. Regression example
